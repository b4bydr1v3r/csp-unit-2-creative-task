# This is my creative task for the Unit 2 of CMU Academy
#
# I coded the logo of my favorite Formula 1 driver, Lando Norris
#
# - if you click on the canvas, the background will change with the colors of the Mclaren Mastercard Formula 1 Team
# -Every click will also create a new label that says "LET'S GO LANDO", a famous song and slogan of the driver
# 
# -If you click on one of the two triangle of the logo, the logo will change color, this to celebrate the partnership with Gulf Racing and to remeber the special Monaco livery
